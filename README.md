SHA-256 File Checksum Algorithm was developed to help in verifying the integrity of a file you've downloaded, 
checking that the copy of the downloaded file is identical to the original.

A single character change in a file produces a totally different Hash in output.

To use the algorithm, you need to download the folder and inside it, execute the command below:
```
cargo run -- "file path here"
